We are currently open with around 300 employees on numerous shifts. This business receives and ships music equipment which to many of us in not essential during this health pandemic. Many of us have called 311 to report this business, we were told an inspector came out yesterday and deemed this business essential because they provide hand sanitizer to their workers.  In the course of our workday there\u2019s no way we can maintain 6 feet distance and continue to work, they are also allowing overtime with numerous people from other shifts coming in. This is adding to the amount of people in the building at one time. No one here wants to be without work but we also don\u2019t want to become infected with the COVID19 virus and put our families at risk all for shipping out drums and speakers. Is this business truly essential during this pandemic? Who can we contact to really investigate this business and help protect the community from possibly more exposure to this dangerous virus?
